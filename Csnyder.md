For this assignment, Andy and I were interested in looking at a "hot" issue. After some debate, and much searching on Twitter (turns out there are not lots of twitter-hip authors that we are mutually interested in), we decided to focus on Planned Parenthood. From there, we explored various ways to "capture" the organization's contention. Rather than use the hashtag #istandwithpp, we chose to look at the organization’s action fund via their PPACT account. 
Using PPACT as our searchterm we created a Twitter dataset containing 2971 tweets, which appear to have been collected on Friday, December 4, 2015 between 21:10:06 and 03:03:08. During this 6-hour period, enough tweets contained #PPACT to fill the TAGS limit. We configured API type search/tweets for the term PPACT to see what types of conversations were happening around Planned Parenthood and who was doing the talking. 

To try and get at who was actively tweeting about the organization, we created a pivot table based on the category in_reply_to_screen_name. Here are the most active repliers (not counting PPACT):

(37) @MLCzone: left identified, northern Californian who issues a warning to trolls: “Warning: Mean and rude to trolls”. This person is probably a woman (based on some pictures). Race, unknown. 
(21) @MrsCaliBlonde: female (cis-gendered), white conservative, also from California, married with kids, likes to use the hashtags #NRA #tcot #ccot. Possibly named Hawaiian Princess. 
(12) @redsteeze: white, conservative, male (cis-gendered) named Stephen Miller who lives in Brooklyn, New York, and who has been featured on The Rush Limbaugh Show. 
(10) @LilaGraceRose: white, female (cis-gendered) who went to college in California and is now the President of Live Action, an organization dedicated to ending abortion. 
(9) @wdcfootballfan: L. Alford is a surgeon who lives in Silver Spring and is a huge fan of the DC Football team. She is presumably a black female. 

What these numbers captured were mostly back and forths between citizen-users: @MLCzone and @MrsCaliBlonde had the highest number of exchanges followed by @wdcfootballfan and @PastorSkeet. @LilaGrace and @redsteeze make their living railing against Planned Parenthood. Besides these active exchanges, there are many tweeters coming in at 4-7 replies, including POTUS. 

Andy and I also played around with the “Explore” function at the bottom right hand of the spreadsheet, which told us that all tweets were in English and gave stats about the user’s friend counts.

There are many things we could not find by using the free TAGS add-on. For instance, it is impossible to access the data outside Twitter’s time range such as the tweets that immediately followed the clinic shooting in Colorado. It is also difficult to arrange the data in terms of tweet content; it seems like this plug is more suited to user-related (re)organization (who is talking to whom, and how many followers do folks have).
